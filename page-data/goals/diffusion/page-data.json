A small organization is made of one social unit, allowing ideas to spread rapidly across the whole system, and the organization learns together. However, as an organization scales up its size, it begins to fracture into multiple social units encapsulated in communication boundaries. Teams who do not work directly together have limited ways of communicating ideas outside of the team. This in turn slows the diffusion of ideas and innovations across the organization.</p>\n<p>Our hypothesis is that transactional communication (emails, presentations, adhoc conversations) have limited ability to facilitate diffusion. When a person becomes part of a team and works with that team towards a common goal, a far deeper understanding and more effective learning process can take place. This learning is bi-directional, which makes it particularly good for guiding platform teams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circulating-perspectives-and-innovations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#circulating-perspectives-and-innovations\" aria-label=\"circulating perspectives and innovations permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Circulating Perspectives and Innovations</h2>\n<p>Keeping a subset of the organization regularly moving between teams and domains accelerates the diffusion of ideas in much the same way that stirring water dramatically increases how the diffusion of dyes dropped into it. New ideas, best practices, and learnings are always entering an organization through individuals. Unless additional action is taken, those innovations will remain localized.</p>\n<p>Some ideas are significant enough that they should be spread deliberately, for example, through training, email, or presentations. However, there will be many ideas which are not sufficiently observable or impactful to be picked up by this type of communication. Many good ideas and practices will therefore not effectively spread across a large organization, and in aggregate these add up to a significant opportunity cost for the organization as a whole. Today, in any given organization, there are likely dozens or hundreds of improvements which are remain localized within the teams that learned them.</p>\n<p>An Auxiliary Engineer embedded within a team creates an opportunity for rich bi-directional learning. When the engagement completes and the Auxiliary Engineer moves on to work with another team, they bring with them some of the strengths and perspectives from the first team. Over time, the Auxiliary Engineer learns from a growing number of teams, and is able to spread those learnings across the organization rapidly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"durably-changing-behavior-by-changing-habits\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#durably-changing-behavior-by-changing-habits\" aria-label=\"durably changing behavior by changing habits permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Durably Changing Behavior By Changing Habits</h2>\n<p>One of the most powerful ways we’ve found to durably change a team’s behaviors is to influence their habits, and we subscribe to the theory that it takes roughly 10 weeks for a new habit to be formed. When an Aux Engineer begins working with a team, one of the first things they should be doing is identifying what habits they’d like to instill in the team. Disrupting habits in the beginning, and then consistently reinforcing the change throughout the duration of an engagement. The goal is by the end of the 3 months some old habits have been replaced with new ones and they are far more likely to take.</p>\n<p>A common example we’ve come across is appropriately prioritizing code reviews above project work. If you discuss this with a team, and they understand and agree with a change, it’s still a long hard uphill battle to get a change like this to take. There are many habits, feedback loops, and incentives which are likely reinforcing the original behaviors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bring-new-perspectives-to-old-problems\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bring-new-perspectives-to-old-problems\" aria-label=\"bring new perspectives to old problems permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bring New Perspectives To Old Problems</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a fresh perspective can do wonders to helping a team rethink long standing problems. Over time all teams lose their ability to see their domain for the first time, and they collectively begin to solidify on certain assumptions.</p>\n<p>A new hire is a great way to bring this fresh perspective to a domain, but a new hire is also faced with additional challenges. They’re trying to wrap their heads around the entire system as a whole, and they are also feeling out their new team’s personalities. It can be risky to make too many suggestions early and be perceived as a threat by more tenured members of the team. These two factors can curtail a new team member’s ability to form and share their fresh perspectives with the team.</p>\n<p>When someone is invited to join a team as part of an Aux Engagement, they benefit from their existing domain knowledge within the organization, and their temporary role makes them less likely to be perceived, even unconsciously, as a threat to existing engineers.</p>\n<p>For this to be effective, it is important that the auxiliary engineer be brought on with the appropriate context and buy-in from the team.
