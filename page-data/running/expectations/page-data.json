We think through these ideas carefully and publish our\nopinion of how they apply to our team in a conspicuous place. Usually on an\ninternal webpage about our team and practices; included in any e-mails or\ninternal messages about our team to prospective “away” teams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Aux Engineer will not do the hard work.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aux Engineers can help with what they’re able to help with. They cannot\nnecessarily crush all problems on a given team — they can crush problems within\ntheir domain relevant to the success of an engagement. Fiercely defending the\ntime spent on a team is important to ensure maximum diffusion and engagement\ngoal progress.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Diffusion is the primary goal and project success is the secondary goal.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Diffusion of cultural changes like testing, usage of a standardized tool, etc,\nshould come second to achieving some particular engagement goal. AuxEng is used\nat Wayfair to proliferate usage of a tool or practice, not to burn down backlogs\nfor any team.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Weekly retros and schedules are important. Critical feedback is strongly encouraged.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s important to understand what scheduled rituals are important for you and\nyour team — and encourage that replacements or alternatives have to achieve the\nsame goals. For example, retros are a time to understand progress and get\nfeedback. Without a replacement, everyone should attend and engage in retros,\nor the model does not mutually benefit engagement “host” and “away” teams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>If failure modes persist, the engagement will end early.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Setting the expectation that an engagement must continue working for everyone\nearly is important. It will save heartache and pain explaining later to make\nthis clear from the get-go: Mutually beneficial engineering time over a 10 week\nperiod will only continue so long as the work is genuinely beneficial according\nto both parties. It must also meaningfully progress toward diffusion and/or\nengagement goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prepare-the-pitch\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prepare-the-pitch\" aria-label=\"prepare the pitch permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Prepare the Pitch</h2>\n<p>The general flow we’ve used in pitch meetings goes something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is AuxEng?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simply clarify key words, tools, and layout of your team and AuxEng. We explain\nembeds, engagements, trainings, and other ways our team may engage with an organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is (team)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We take time to emphasize our team’s direction and mission. Are we proliferating\na practice? Is that practice centered around a tool?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why AuxEng?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the framework of all the ways a team can engage other teams in an organization,\nit’s a reasonable tangent to mention exactly why AuxEng is the approach that any\ngiven team is making.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does an embed do?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An “Embed” is the part of an engagement where AuxEng engineers actually code and\nhelp a team. Hopefully this guide and website gives enough of a definition that\nyou feel ready to answer this question.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do we get started?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where much of the framework we’ve said so far comes together. To start\nthis process and invite folks in to collaborate, we need them to give us a one\npager, explaining their problem and solution, so we can evaluate if it makes\nsense for our team to engage.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/running/expectations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Engagement Expectations","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/ce373ecbd25c1f0480e7b0c99487d226/87cb2/running.png","height":400,"width":600}}}}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"5a71defc-9aea-5079-91fa-fa9e953f51bd","fields":{"slug":"/example/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Example Engagement"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"7bc0d22a-3c38-53b5-8e8a-c3e36b504838","fields":{"slug":"/goals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Engagement Goals"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"ad0b0ab8-1743-55bb-b196-344f395e6114","fields":{"slug":"/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Auxiliary Engineering"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"c12c8b20-aec1-5451-a827-d8fec99c0544","fields":{"slug":"/running/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Engagements"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"b8c6b80c-65ed-55cb-9521-198b88b783cb","fields":{"slug":"/theory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Theory"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"b6f61c55-57eb-5040-9f6e-292c25e873f2","fields":{"slug":"/example/overview/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Work In Progress Notes"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"example"}}},{"node":{"id":"84d935bf-c7a9-5844-a40c-fe1c7867cfc3","fields":{"slug":"/goals/careers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Career"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"a6c7f3ed-9eb4-56ce-bc94-3b4a1ede25a9","fields":{"slug":"/goals/diffusion/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Organizational"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"6c8547d6-c31f-52fd-8442-95742cc79570","fields":{"slug":"/goals/mobility/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mobility"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"3b8bc4cd-2ee5-5ed1-9db8-fd9f3b2ae501","fields":{"slug":"/goals/platforms/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Platform"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"dfa5a7ea-8158-5ea2-ad03-1e2bab29e04c","fields":{"slug":"/running/executing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Executing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"e03b5025-8a1c-5745-9fe1-ea45cb7c09bf","fields":{"slug":"/running/expectations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Engagement Expectations"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"caea17b4-32c4-53e0-a727-bfa517aecfa1","fields":{"slug":"/running/planning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Planning"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8090bb90-3ceb-5a5f-a5a2-ca1c2cbb9694","fields":{"slug":"/running/roles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roles"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8f0b89e4-3aa2-5f94-976b-175ef6ebd821","fields":{"slug":"/running/sourcing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sourcing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8fc3f421-8090-55a8-9e07-9ab9cfc6c7a7","fields":{"slug":"/running/wrapping-up/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wrapping Up"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"d2d12edf-cd96-59d0-9998-acc94e7f5028","fields":{"slug":"/theory/concepts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Concepts"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"8c3f4225-f12d-53d4-b9df-821623922aac","fields":{"slug":"/theory/elements/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elements"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"8d6f43e4-f408-5984-9b4d-a6c0cfbcf3e0","fields":{"slug":"/theory/failure_modes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Failure Modes"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"59012ed4-d0fa-5cb1-b7b4-303499e5686e","fields":{"slug":"/theory/marketing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Marketing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/running/expectations/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","3983085624"]}
