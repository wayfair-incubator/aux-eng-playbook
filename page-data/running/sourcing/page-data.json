We will explain to the team what our AuxEng program is and give\nthem some general direction on how to proceed with their project.</p>\n<p>Most questions we get and most outline we give stem from the mission of the\nAuxEng team that sponsors the engineer. For example, we might have a team that\nheavily focuses on best practices for Python. We outline how we make life\nbetter for engineers that use our recommended tools, how we help setup automation\nand quality of life improvements for folks we engage with, and <a href=\"../expectations#prepare-the-pitch\">generally pitch</a>\nthe value we believe our team can bring.</p>\n<p>If the team seems interested in AuxEng, and their project seems like a good fit\nfor us, then we ask them to submit a one page document describing what they\nintend to build.</p>\n<h2 id=\"one-pager\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#one-pager\" aria-label=\"one pager permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>One-Pager</h2>\n<p>We ask teams to submit a one page document describing what they intend to build\nwhen they express interest in AuxEng. This allows us to see a condensed version\nof their project. It also gives us an artifact to discuss internally.</p>\n<p>The commitment we can expect from a team will also be apparent from one-pager.\nFor example, we may find that a team is very interested in an intro meeting,\nspeaking over email, and/over DM. When asked to describe their problem, commit\ntechnologists, or other resources, they hesitate. We take the effort in a one-pager\nto heart when considering an engagement. A team that expects a rigid structure\nor form to submit their one-pager idea likely has low resources to affect\nmeaningful change in their work habits, and may not receive the full\nbenefit AuxEng can provide.</p>\n<p>While we don’t provide a strict template for a one-pager, we will generally\nwant a problem statement, wish list, and some goals (business and technical).</p>\n<p>After receiving a one-pager, We meet internally to rate the one-pager on\nthree metrics; business value, technical value, and team fit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checking-project-fit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#checking-project-fit\" aria-label=\"checking project fit permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Checking Project Fit</h2>\n<p>After some introductions and receiving a project brief via a one-pager, we\ncollect our team and make decisions on if we should proceed. To avoid bias\nfor or against a particular engagement, we will judge based on three tenets\nimportant to the success of any project: Business Value, Technical Value, and\nTeam Fit.</p>\n<p>It’s best to run this meeting with as much numbers as possible to measure\nsentiment. One example would be “Roman Voting” with a 0 for thumbs down, 1\nfor thumb sideways, and 2 for thumb up in each category listed below.\nIt’s often that multiple engagements must be considered next to one\nanother, and having a numerical score can reduce bias and choose the best\nengagement for our team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"business-value\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#business-value\" aria-label=\"business value permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Business Value</h3>\n<p>We are careful to look for projects that we feel will have a measurable impact\non Wayfair’s performance. We often look for projects that can associate a\ndollar amount with getting their minimum viable product into production.\nThe value of an engagement creating a service that indirectly saves dollars,\nor otherwise assisting a team that creatives multiplicative value is also\nworth considering.</p>\n<p>A major refactor of a legacy system is an example of a project that we would\nconsider to have low business value. It might solve a lot of problems for\nengineers, but it most likely has little to no immediate value for the business\nitself. It’s important to weigh this as a <em>part</em> of choosing an engagement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-value\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#technical-value\" aria-label=\"technical value permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technical Value</h3>\n<p>We get excited about project that allow us to learn new things, or do something\nthat has never been done at Wayfair before.</p>\n<p>We also look for projects that will have a major effect on a large team of\nengineers. Projects that further technical goals for leadership or for known\npopulations (and/or with measurable gaps in their technical needs) are great\ncandidates for high technical value projects. We also consider helping a\nlarge team move to a more modern paradigm to have high technical value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"team-fit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#team-fit\" aria-label=\"team fit permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Team Fit</h3>\n<p>We normally pair with a team for three months, so we really care about team fit.\nHaving poor team fit can ruin an otherwise good project, and cause unnecessary\nfriction between AuxEng and the host team. We will discuss problems can be\nlogistical, or technical, or both.</p>\n<p>Logistically, a team may prefer to hold their stand-up at 6 PM, while an aux\nengineer must be clocked out by 5. They may have a distributed team that makes\nit difficult to effectively pair with reasonable overlap across time zones. We’ve\nseen teams that even prefer to have night owls working late into the night,\nand take some of the next day off. The working habits of our team must\nmeaningfully overlap to have a successful AuxEng engagement.</p>\n<p>Technically, we write tests for our code, and we believe that high test coverage\nallows us to move faster, onboard engineers quicker, and refactor more easily.\nWe deeply believe in testing, linting, containerized development, maintaining\nhigh test coverage, and CI/CD. Some teams believe these practices will “slow\nthem down” and will “block them from deploying”. Writing tests is a skill,\nat first it is hard and can take work to learn. If a team isn’t interested\nin learning to write tests then they are not a good fit for AuxEng.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/running/sourcing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sourcing","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/ce373ecbd25c1f0480e7b0c99487d226/87cb2/running.png","height":400,"width":600}}}}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"7bc0d22a-3c38-53b5-8e8a-c3e36b504838","fields":{"slug":"/goals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aux Eng Goals"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"ad0b0ab8-1743-55bb-b196-344f395e6114","fields":{"slug":"/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Auxiliary Engineering"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"b8c6b80c-65ed-55cb-9521-198b88b783cb","fields":{"slug":"/theory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Theory"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"c12c8b20-aec1-5451-a827-d8fec99c0544","fields":{"slug":"/running/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Engagements"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"84d935bf-c7a9-5844-a40c-fe1c7867cfc3","fields":{"slug":"/goals/careers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Career"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"a6c7f3ed-9eb4-56ce-bc94-3b4a1ede25a9","fields":{"slug":"/goals/diffusion/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Organizational"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"6c8547d6-c31f-52fd-8442-95742cc79570","fields":{"slug":"/goals/mobility/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mobility"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"3b8bc4cd-2ee5-5ed1-9db8-fd9f3b2ae501","fields":{"slug":"/goals/platforms/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Platform"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"dfa5a7ea-8158-5ea2-ad03-1e2bab29e04c","fields":{"slug":"/running/executing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Executing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"e03b5025-8a1c-5745-9fe1-ea45cb7c09bf","fields":{"slug":"/running/expectations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Engagement Expectations"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"caea17b4-32c4-53e0-a727-bfa517aecfa1","fields":{"slug":"/running/planning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Planning"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8090bb90-3ceb-5a5f-a5a2-ca1c2cbb9694","fields":{"slug":"/running/roles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roles"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8f0b89e4-3aa2-5f94-976b-175ef6ebd821","fields":{"slug":"/running/sourcing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sourcing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8fc3f421-8090-55a8-9e07-9ab9cfc6c7a7","fields":{"slug":"/running/wrapping-up/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wrapping Up"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"d2d12edf-cd96-59d0-9998-acc94e7f5028","fields":{"slug":"/theory/concepts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Concepts"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"8c3f4225-f12d-53d4-b9df-821623922aac","fields":{"slug":"/theory/elements/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elements"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"8d6f43e4-f408-5984-9b4d-a6c0cfbcf3e0","fields":{"slug":"/theory/failure_modes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Failure Modes"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"59012ed4-d0fa-5cb1-b7b4-303499e5686e","fields":{"slug":"/theory/marketing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Marketing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/running/sourcing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","3983085624"]}
