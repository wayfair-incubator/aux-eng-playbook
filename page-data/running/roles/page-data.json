They\nwill have systems in place to take feedback from engineers and prioritize it\nfor their backlog. They will have to be able to live without the Aux Engineer for the\n10-week period of an engagement. They will spend plenty of time finding folks who wish\nto have their team embedded with an Aux Engineer to run any engagements.</p>\n<p>The home team will have at least one <a href=\"#project-engineer\">project engineer</a> and one\n<a href=\"#project-advisor\">project advisor</a>. They should not be the same person for the same\nengagement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"host-team--away-team\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#host-team--away-team\" aria-label=\"host team  away team permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Host Team / “Away” Team</h2>\n<p>A Host team is any team that engages with a home team through AuxEng. Put another\nway: any team that makes use of a team offering engineers through Aux\nEngagements. A Host Team should have resources dedicated to pair programming\nduring the engagement. However: it is the job of the Home team to drive culture\nand technology changes during the course of an engagement.</p>\n<p>On a project there should be at least 2 folks working with the host
