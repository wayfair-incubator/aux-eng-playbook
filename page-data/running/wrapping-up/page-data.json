It’s tempting for other teams to view your team as “free\npeople” that will work to simply burn down a backlog.</p>\n<p>It’s up to a team running AuxEng to keep this work separate, and this line\nbecomes especially important to hold after an engagement ends. If a team\ncontinues to expect more than a reasonable helping hand after an engagement\nends, something has gone wrong. Remember that the work for your team is\non your team, and the work for another team should be the same.</p>\n<p>Don’t lose hope! Setting boundaries for work your team will do after an\nengagement (none) and where they can go for help as your team is available\nwill often solve this problem. Escalate to management and within your own\norganization as necessary, keeping in mind a simple conversation will\nalmost always alleviate any confusion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"three-month-check-in\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#three-month-check-in\" aria-label=\"three month check in permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Three Month Check-in</h2>\n<p>We care deeply that our AuxEng projects are set up for long term success.\nAlthough during the project we focus on getting the host teams MVP into prod, we\nhope that the projects we work on have a long term impact.</p>\n<p>Three months after the project is finished we have an informal check-in with the\nhost team. We are interested in any feedback they have for us, and want to hear\nhow the project is shaping up after we left.</p>\n<p>We are wary of the host team building too much dependency on AuxEng, which is a\nfailure in our eyes. During the three month check-in we ask the host team about\nhow they are fairing, and if they feel comfortable maintaining what we built\ntogether.</p>\n<p>We use this sentiment within the team to gauge success of our products’\nmaintenance, instead of initial setup and usage. The report that an engaged\nteam can and would provide is usually more candid; compared to what we\nexpect from teams that do not have a similar connection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"following-up\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#following-up\" aria-label=\"following up permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Following Up</h2>\n<p>We find connections throughout Wayfair when we practice AuxEng. Sometimes\nthose connections make little sense to keep tight relationships with after\nan engagement ends.</p>\n<p>Other times, it makes sense to keep a post-engagement set of colleagues\ntogether in 1-1 conversations, or regular monthly sync ups. Tech leads can\ngive great feedback about the team’s progress culturally, individual\ncontributors will have the most direct input on how well practices and tools\nare proliferating through their team, and managers will give a bigger picture\nof the impact engagements have had over time.</p>\n<p>Building connections that endure through shared success and mistakes will\ncreate empathy and understanding between teams. Make the best use of that\nempathy to drive team success and better decisions for product and strategic\ndirection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-label=\"whats next permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>In short: Do it again!</p>\n<p>We measure success from an engagement with business and technical goals achieved.\nWe wse NPS to understand how a hosting team felt about the progress technically,\nand product wise, from any engagement effort. We use what practices worked for\nus and reconsider the ones that didn’t work.
