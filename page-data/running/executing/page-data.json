During the weekly retros we talk about how close we are to\nlaunching the MVP, and what is blocking us.</p>\n<p>We take notes during this meeting, and after we email the notes to everyone that\ncame.

Friday is a great time to\nreflect on an engagement, write documentation that is missing from\nproducts a team provides, give ourself downtime away from a host team\nand time to stay involved with an engineers “home” team.</p>\n<p>Most Aux Engineers will be coming from a team out to change the culture\nof other teams or provide insight an expertise on a platform product.\nIf an Aux Engineer is teaching other teams about kubernetes, for\nexample, they would likely have to change mindset about application\ninfrastructure as well as the actual code. With time to decompress and\ntake any thoughts from the “away” or “host team to the “home” team —\nwe create a feedback loop that creates a better experience for the rest\nof an engagement.
