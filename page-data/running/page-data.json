This could be the rate of flow through an order processing system, or measuring user interactions on a web page.\nThis helps prevent us from working on a project that is deployed to production but is never used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-meetings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#scheduling-meetings\" aria-label=\"scheduling meetings permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Scheduling Meetings</h2>\n<p>Once we’ve decided on the project goals and metrics, we start discussing scheduling with the host team.\nWe try to line up our projects with the start and end of quarters.\nWe also try to give our engineers 3 weeks off between projects to focus on platform work.\nWithout some time off between projects it can be easy to burn out.\nGiven those constraints, we work with the host team to set up a start and an end date for the project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kick-off-meeting\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#kick-off-meeting\" aria-label=\"kick off meeting permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Kick Off Meeting</h2>\n<p>During the first week of the project we set up a kickoff meeting with the\ndevelopers, the product managers, and anyone else who is interested.</p>\n<p>At the kickoff meeting we communicate expectations about how we will be\ndeveloping.
