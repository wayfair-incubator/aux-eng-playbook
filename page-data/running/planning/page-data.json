We should set goals aspirational enough that we likely won’t\ncomplete them all. We aim for finishing about 75%.\nGenerally these goals fit on one page, and range from code quality metrics to\nminimum viable product features. We reinforce the metrics that matter most for\nus and a hosting team — as well as the business impact we expect to make and how\nit benefits the team.</p>\n<p>We only measure the MVP goals once the application is fully deployed and in production.\nWe focus on deploying a high quality MVP with a small feature set to production as\nquickly as possible.\nWe generally have a goal measuring production adoption. This could be the rate of\nflow through an order processing system, or measuring user interactions on a web\npage. This helps prevent us from working on a project that is deployed to\nproduction but is never used.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind we should have a mix of technical and business goals. This ensures\nboth management layers of a team as well as engineers have a clear understanding\nof how they can contribute, and feel invested in the success of the engagement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-meetings\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#scheduling-meetings\" aria-label=\"scheduling meetings permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Scheduling Meetings</h2>\n<p>Once we’ve decided on the project goals and metrics, we start discussing\nscheduling with the host team.\nWe try to line up our projects with the start and end of quarters.\nWe also try to give our engineers 3 weeks off between projects to focus on\nplatform work.
