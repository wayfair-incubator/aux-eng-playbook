The failure modes are typical of all software engineering, but can\nbe especially potent in this context given the short timeline of an engagement.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Engineer does all the hard work</strong><br>\nIf the embedded engineer finds themselves solving hard problems in isolation,\nwithout opportunities to pair, teach, or share, this is a cause for concern.\nThe embedded engineer should be pairing on large problems and sharing\ndecision-making  with the team, not operating as a contractor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Engineer does not feel welcome</strong><br>\nIf the embedded engineer does not feel psychologically safe on the team, this\nis a cause for concern. The embedded engineer should feel able to share their\nopinions openly during code reviews, retros, and other communication with\nteam members or leadership. If this is not the case, this seriously affects\nthe embedded engineers ability to affect change within the team by limiting\nthe engineers ability to provide negative feedback. Negative feedback can be\ninstrumental in affecting change of a bad-habit type behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A disconnect between the team and leadership</strong><br>\nIf there is a misunderstanding or misalignment between the team and\nleadership, this can undermine the stability of the engagement. This could\ntake the form of excited leadership with under-engaged team, or a team with\none goal in mind and leadership with another. This can result in a team that\ncommits to a large idea on paper but does not execute, and cancelled\npartnerships mid-engagement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lack of improvements to platform layer</strong><br>\nIf the embedded engineer does not leave an engagement having identified\npotential improvements to platform tooling, this is a missed opportunity.\nEmbedding on a team and operating as a contractor is missing the opportunity\nto learn about the imperfections of a software platform through operating as\na customer of that platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Team size too small to impact change</strong><br>\nIf a team to be embedded with is too small (1-4 members) this will affect the\nembedded engineers ability to affect change on the team. Larger teams should\nbe preferred to maximize face-time and visibility of the work being done, and\nto allow for team-members to pair with each other to reinforce new habits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Team goes back to bad habits</strong><br>\nIf a team that has had an auxiliary engagement is returning to previous\npatterns and habits, this is a red flag. This can be due to a time-constrained\nengagement where new habits were not thoroughly reinforced. This can result in\nthe work done by the embedded engineer being treated as if the engineer was\na contractor, undermining the ultimate goal of auxiliary engineering.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/theory/failure_modes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Failure Modes","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/2500cc8cf60863582790df44d22e9de9/87cb2/theory.png","height":400,"width":600}}}}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"7bc0d22a-3c38-53b5-8e8a-c3e36b504838","fields":{"slug":"/goals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aux Eng Goals"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"ad0b0ab8-1743-55bb-b196-344f395e6114","fields":{"slug":"/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Auxiliary Engineering"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"b8c6b80c-65ed-55cb-9521-198b88b783cb","fields":{"slug":"/theory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Theory"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"c12c8b20-aec1-5451-a827-d8fec99c0544","fields":{"slug":"/running/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Engagements"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":""}}},{"node":{"id":"84d935bf-c7a9-5844-a40c-fe1c7867cfc3","fields":{"slug":"/goals/careers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Career"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"a6c7f3ed-9eb4-56ce-bc94-3b4a1ede25a9","fields":{"slug":"/goals/diffusion/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Organizational"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"6c8547d6-c31f-52fd-8442-95742cc79570","fields":{"slug":"/goals/mobility/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mobility"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"3b8bc4cd-2ee5-5ed1-9db8-fd9f3b2ae501","fields":{"slug":"/goals/platforms/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Platform"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"goals"}}},{"node":{"id":"dfa5a7ea-8158-5ea2-ad03-1e2bab29e04c","fields":{"slug":"/running/executing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Executing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"e03b5025-8a1c-5745-9fe1-ea45cb7c09bf","fields":{"slug":"/running/expectations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Engagement Expectations"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"caea17b4-32c4-53e0-a727-bfa517aecfa1","fields":{"slug":"/running/planning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Planning"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8090bb90-3ceb-5a5f-a5a2-ca1c2cbb9694","fields":{"slug":"/running/roles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roles"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8f0b89e4-3aa2-5f94-976b-175ef6ebd821","fields":{"slug":"/running/sourcing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sourcing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"8fc3f421-8090-55a8-9e07-9ab9cfc6c7a7","fields":{"slug":"/running/wrapping-up/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wrapping Up"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"running"}}},{"node":{"id":"d2d12edf-cd96-59d0-9998-acc94e7f5028","fields":{"slug":"/theory/concepts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Concepts"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"8c3f4225-f12d-53d4-b9df-821623922aac","fields":{"slug":"/theory/elements/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elements"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"8d6f43e4-f408-5984-9b4d-a6c0cfbcf3e0","fields":{"slug":"/theory/failure_modes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Failure Modes"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}},{"node":{"id":"59012ed4-d0fa-5cb1-b7b4-303499e5686e","fields":{"slug":"/theory/marketing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Marketing"},"parent":{"relativeDirectory":"theory"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/theory/failure_modes/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","3983085624"]}
