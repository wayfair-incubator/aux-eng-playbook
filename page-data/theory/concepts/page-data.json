However, it’s important to recognize that it is distinct from all of those. It is uniquely focused on facilitating a lasting transformative effect on a team, circulating best practices across a large organization, and driving innovation at the platform level. Here are a few key concepts which are key to executing on this model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limited-duration-of-engagements\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#limited-duration-of-engagements\" aria-label=\"limited duration of engagements permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Limited Duration of Engagements</h2>\n<p>AuxEng projects should last no more than a quarter.

We do this consistently for everyone on Friday to achieve the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeps the engineer involved with the platform team even during engagements</li>\n<li>Provides mental space for experimental divergent thinking during the time of an intense engagement.</li>\n<li>Provides the chance to improve the platform or contribute to open source projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-strong-focus-on-self-sufficiency\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-strong-focus-on-self-sufficiency\" aria-label=\"a strong focus on self sufficiency permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A strong focus on self-sufficiency</h2>\n<p>There is a very real risk and temptation for a host team to push on AuxEng to implement complex features independently, but we state this clearly as a failure mode of a project. AuxEng is constantly looking out for things that would erode a team’s self-sufficiency, and therefore are keen to pair with engineers on the host team for complex features. This ensures that upon completion of the project, a host team does not end up reliant on AuxEng for future iterations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-goals-are-expressed-as-business-value\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#technical-goals-are-expressed-as-business-value\" aria-label=\"technical goals are expressed as business value permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technical goals are expressed as business value</h2>\n<p>Auxiliary Engineers leverage best practices such as testing, linting, CI, and code quality to move very quickly towards an MVP goal.
