- Dirsruption / Habbit setting
    - Figure out early what patterns we want to change
    - Start changing behaviors
    - Make any big changes early
        - Prioritizing reviews
        - Investing in pipelines / tests
        - Code formating / linting changes
        - Now is the time to disrupt
    - Reinforce habbits
        - Spend 2+ months reinforcing habits / technology usage
        - Try not to introduce large behavioral changes towards middle/end
- Weekly Retros
    - Start with goal/OKR progress
        - Metric the matters the most... what is it this week?
        - Always call this out first, it keeps the team focused on outcomes
    - Consider rotating responsibility of running the retro
    - Encourage critical feedback
        - Especially feedback on the platform itself
    - Consider holding these on Thursday
        - It leads into self directed Friday
        - opportunity to take action on newly discovered quick wins
- Using Fridays Effectively
    - Fridays are 20% time with a few goals
    - We covered 20% time in the previous section
    - AuxEng has additional benefits
    - It's time to address feedback received in retros
        - If you hold retros on thursday, this information is very fresh
    - An example:
        - Documentation is generally not the most enjoyable work
            - often easy to deprioritize
        - If you see someone struggle due to lack of documentation, and it comes up in a retro:
            - Taking immediate action feels rewarding
            - You understand the actual gap with real feedback
            - The person who felt friction feels encouraged by the rapid support
            - Everyone wins
        - Contrast this to a backlog of documentation changes one has to burndown.
    - Fridays also serve other benefits:
        - Downtime from AuxEng projects
        - Not be away from home team for too long. Keeps the person involved
        - Provides a "minimal-disruptive" day to take off
        - Provides time to think about the Platform-level of the auxeng project
