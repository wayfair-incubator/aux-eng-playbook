# Auxiliary Engineering

Auxiliary Engineering is an internal consulting model developed at Wayfair by Jonathan Biddle and Alex Truslow. Its primary goals are to [diffuse best practices](goals/diffusion.md) across the organization, and [drive platform improvements](goals/platforms.md). There are other secondary benefits such as: enabling [mobility of engineering talent](goals/mobility.md) and providing an attractive [role archetype](goals/careers.md) for experienced software engineers.

We have run dozens of these engagements with overwhelming success and are making this playbook available so other organizations can adopt what we believe is a powerful model for large organizations.
