## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES

- Synthesize the product function
- Justifying funding for the platform team can be difficult as it is indirect business value
- AuxEng allows you to staff a platform team up with senior talent while still directly contributing to business outcomes
- Knowing the right problems to solve can be difficult. Being embedded brings challenges, low hanging fruit to the surface.
  - Impossible for a senior engineer to know what it's like to be a junior engineer, or not know the platform
  - Seeing a junior engineer struggle makes points of friction clear
  - Engineers experiencing pain don't always realize when something is easy to improve.
- Giving AuxEngineers 1 day per week to make self-directed investments / explorations in the platform gives them is powerful
  - Self-direction is powerful. Process adds friction
  - Short feedback loops. Experience pain -> Solve problem
  - Writing documentation can be draining, but not nearly as much when you are solving a problem just experienced first hand
    - You feel like you're helping someone
    - That person validates and expresses gratitude. Feels rewarding
