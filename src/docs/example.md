Auxiliary Engineering is an internal consulting model developed at Wayfair by Jonathan Biddle, Alex Truslow, and Development Platforms.

Its primary goals are to [diffuse best practices](goals/diffusion.md) across the organization, and [drive platform improvements](goals/platforms.md). There are other secondary benefits such as: enabling [mobility of engineering talent](goals/mobility.md) and providing an attractive [role archetype](goals/careers.md) for experienced software engineers.

We have run dozens of these engagements across several engineering languages and disciplines disciplines with overwhelming success. We are making this playbook available so other organizations can adopt what we believe is a powerful collaboration and skill sharing model for large organizations.
