Auxiliary Engineering is an internal consulting model developed at Wayfair by Jonathan Biddle for Python and Development Platforms. It has grown and adapted across many teams, including those outside the immediate DevPlats team.

Its primary goals are to [diffuse best practices](goals/diffusion.md) across an organization, and [drive platform improvements](goals/platforms.md). There are other secondary benefits such as: enabling [mobility of engineering talent](goals/mobility.md) and providing an attractive [role archetype](goals/careers.md) for experienced software engineers.

Dozens of these engagements across several engineering languages and disciplines disciplines have shown overwhelming success for this model. This section of our site will walk through an "example engagement". We'll outline good and bad situations, how to encourage good behavior and correct everything else.
