## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES
- Marketing applies internally just like a business
    - Real revenue comes from leadership sponsorship in the form of a budget of some kind
    - If this is a high point of leverage, it needs to be known / communicated
    - Take a "show don't tell" approach
- Recognition
    - Do case studies
    - Co-brand project communication
- Protecting the Brand
    - If a team does auxeng, make sure they're actually following the model
    - Typical embedded engineering is actually a stated failure mode of auxeng because it builds dependency
