## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES

- Marketing applies internally just like a business
  - Real revenue comes from leadership sponsorship in the form of a budget of some kind
  - If this is a high point of leverage, it needs to be known / communicated
  - Take a "show don't tell" approach
- Recognition
  - Do case studies
  - Co-brand project communication
- Protecting the Brand
  - If a team does auxeng, make sure they're actually following the model
  - Typical embedded engineering is actually a stated failure mode of auxeng because it builds dependency

Disruption / Habit setting
- Figure out early what patterns we want to change
- Start changing behaviors
- Make any big changes early
  - Prioritizing reviews
  - Investing in pipelines / tests
  - Code formatting / linting changes
  - Now is the time to disrupt
- Reinforce habits
  - Spend 2+ months reinforcing habits / technology usage
  - Try not to introduce large behavioral changes towards middle/end
