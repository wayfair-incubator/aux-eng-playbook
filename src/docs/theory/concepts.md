# Auxiliary Engineering Concepts

AuxEng takes inspiration from several models including Software Consulting, Embedded Engineering, and Matrix Reporting. However, it's important to recognize that it is distinct from all of those. It is uniquely focused on facilitating a lasting transformative effect on a team, circulating best practices across a large organization, and driving innovation at the platform level. Here are a few key concepts which are key to executing on this model.

## Limited Duration of Engagements

AuxEng projects should last no more than a quarter. This has multiple benefits:

- Creates a healthy sense of focused urgency on achieving a clearly scoped MVP
- Allows the AuxEng program to engage with many teams in a year
- Discourages building dependency on AuxEng

## Self-directed days

Auxiliary Engineers have 1 day per week to completely unplug from their current engagement, and spend their time on self-direct projects. We do this consistently for everyone on Friday to achieve the following benefits:

- Keeps the engineer involved with the platform team even during engagements
- Provides mental space for experimental divergent thinking during the time of an intense engagement.
- Provides the chance to improve the platform or contribute to open source projects.

## A strong focus on self-sufficiency

There is a very real risk and temptation for a host team to push on AuxEng to implement complex features independently, but we state this clearly as a failure mode of a project. AuxEng is constantly looking out for things that would erode a team's self-sufficiency, and therefore are keen to pair with engineers on the host team for complex features. This ensures that upon completion of the project, a host team does not end up reliant on AuxEng for future iterations.

## Technical goals are expressed as business value

Auxiliary Engineers leverage best practices such as testing, linting, CI, and code quality to move very quickly towards an MVP goal. Not only does this help build awareness about how best practices translate to business value, it can also helps the host team think develop an increased awareness about short and long term economic impact of their technical decisions.

## Humble experts eager to learn

While there is an expectation of an Auxiliary Engineer is that they're educating the host team in various ways, and that they're an expert in their craft, there's also an expectation that these engineers are learning from each engagement as well, and passing that knowledge on to the platform teams as well as other software teams. For these engagements to be successful, it's very important that both the Auxiliary Engineer and host team minimize ego and build a lasting / healthy relationship.

## Engagement buffers

It's important to give Auxiliary Engineers several weeks of downtime between engagements. This time is spent focusing on platform initiatives and potentially implementing improvements or addressing issues which emerged during their engagement. This also creates a buffer between engagements that allows for a emotional / cognitive reset.
