An Auxiliary Engagement is a hopeful endeavor; there is no guarantee of success.
An engagement can suffer from a number of failure modes, some easier to identify
than others. The failure modes are typical of all software engineering, but can
be especially potent in this context given the short timeline of an engagement.

1. **Auxiliary Engineer does all the hard work**  
    If the embedded engineer finds themselves solving hard problems in isolation,
    without opportunities to pair, teach, or share, this is a cause for concern.
    The embedded engineer should be pairing on large problems and sharing
    decision-making  with the team, not operating as a contractor.

1. **Auxiliary Engineer does not feel welcome**  
    If the embedded engineer does not feel psychologically safe on the team, this
    is a cause for concern. The embedded engineer should feel able to share their
    opinions openly during code reviews, retros, and other communication with
    team members or leadership. If this is not the case, this seriously affects
    the embedded engineers ability to affect change within the team by limiting
    the engineers ability to provide negative feedback. Negative feedback can be
    instrumental in affecting change of a bad-habit type behavior.

1. **A disconnect between the team and leadership**  
    If there is a misunderstanding or misalignment between the team and
    leadership, this can undermine the stability of the engagement. This could
    take the form of excited leadership with under-engaged team, or a team with
    one goal in mind and leadership with another. This can result in a team that
    commits to a large idea on paper but does not execute, and cancelled
    partnerships mid-engagement.

1. **Lack of improvements to platform layer**  
    If the embedded engineer does not leave an engagement having identified
    potential improvements to platform tooling, this is a missed opportunity.
    Embedding on a team and operating as a contractor is missing the opportunity
    to learn about the imperfections of a software platform through operating as
    a customer of that platform.

1. **Team size too small to impact change**  
    If a team to be embedded with is too small (1-4 members) this will affect the
    embedded engineers ability to affect change on the team. Larger teams should
    be preferred to maximize face-time and visibility of the work being done, and
    to allow for team-members to pair with each other to reinforce new habits.

1. **Team goes back to bad habits**  
    If a team that has had an auxiliary engagement is returning to previous
    patterns and habits, this is a red flag. This can be due to a time-constrained
    engagement where new habits were not thoroughly reinforced. This can result in
    the work done by the embedded engineer being treated as if the engineer was
    a contractor, undermining the ultimate goal of auxiliary engineering.
