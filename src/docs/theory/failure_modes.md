## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES

- Typical failure modes of software engineering
- AuxEng Doing the hard work, building dependency
- Not investing upfront in scaffolding
- Disconnect between team and leadership
  - Leaders want AuxEng, but the team doesn't
- AuxEng feeling like an outsider
- Lack of improvements to Platform layer
- Lack of psychological safety in retros
  - Welcome and reward critical feedback
- Being just "embedded engineering"
- Bad ratio of AuxEng to team members (1to6 is upper bound)
