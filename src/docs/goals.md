## Aux Eng Program High-Level Goals

Aux Eng is an internal consulting program structure which helps platform teams
get significantly closer to the teams they enable. This often helps the platform
team [identify previously unknown opportunities](platforms/) to improve other
teams' effectiveness. In other cases, it can be useful to debug a team's
reluctance to adopt a new tool, or a drift away from best practices.

In addition to the primary goals, there are multiple secondary goals which are
also valuable to organizations:

- It's an effective way of creating [mobility of engineering talent](mobility/)
  across the organization.
- It can provide an attractive [engineering role archetype](careers/) for the
  organization's most experienced software engineers.
- In addition to those, there are several other [organizational
  benefits](diffusion/) we've observed in the dozens of engagements we've run.

## Goals Per Engagement

Engagements can sometimes have different goals under different circumstances.
Sometimes those goals will change how the engagement is run. For example,
sometimes a shorter engagement of only a few weeks is sufficient to identify why
a software team's commit size is increasing while their engineering cycle times
are growing longer.

We've used Aux Eng to embed with an early adopter of a new tool, creating a tight
and clear feedback loop which expedites early iterations. The embedded engineer
can see firsthand how the tool is succeeding (or not) in achieving its desired
outcomes.

Here are a few example goals we've come across for specific engagements:

- Drive adoption of a tool or best practice
- Rally around a key business strategic goal with minimal disruption to other
  work streams
- Partner with an early adopter to understand how a new solution is being used
- Debug a behavioral or tooling issue that has been identified
- Spread knowledge and awareness of a new technology or skill set
