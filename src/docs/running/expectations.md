## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES

- Aux engineer will not do the hard work
- Diffusion is the primary goal and project success is the secondary goal.
  - Sacrificing diffusion for the sake of reaching the project goals is not viable
- Weekly retros are important, and critical feedback is strongly encouraged.
- If failure modes persist, the engagement will ended early
