title: "Engagement Expectations"

Before we can start meaningfully engaging an organization, we have to
understand the mission of our team well enough to pitch it to others,
we have to find engineers that are willing to commit themselves to other
teams for extended periods of time, and we have to have engagements that are
worth doing for our team's priority.

This document will outline how we approach engagement in an organization, and
high-level points to reiterate in a document that should come with any [advisor](./roles.md)
to any inital meeting.

## Set a Baseline

We found through having many meetings with many teams that setting expectations
about our team and what will and won't happen in an aux engagement is important.
Think through these ideas casefully and publish our opinion of how they apply
to our team in a conspicuous place. Usually on aninternal webpage about
our team and practices; included in any e-mails or internal messages about
our team to prospective "away" teams.

- Aux engineer will not do the hard work
This basically means that Aux Engineers can help with what they're able to help with. They cannot necessarily crush all problems on a given team -- they can crush problems within their domain relevant to the success of an engagement. Fiercely defending the time spent on a team is important to ensure maxiumum diffusion and engagement goal progress.
- Diffusion is the primary goal and project success is the secondary goal.
Diffusion of cultural changes like testing, usage of a standardized tool, etc, should come second to achieving some particular engagement goal. AuxEng is used at Wayfair to proliferate usage of a tool or practice, not to burn down backlogs for any team.
- Weekly retros and schedules are important, and critical feedback is strongly encouraged.
It's important to understand what scheduled rituals are important for you and your team -- and encourage that replacements or alternatives have to achieve the same goals. For example, retros are a time to understand progress and get feedback. Without a replacement, everyone should attend and engage in retros, or the model does not mutually benefit engagement "host" and "away" teams.
- If failure modes persist, the engagement will ended early
Setting the expectation that an engagement must continue working for everyone early is important. It will save heartache and pain explaining later to make this clear from the get-go: Mutually beneficial engineering time over a 10 week period will only continue so long as the work is genuinely beneficial according to both parties. It must also meaningfully progress toward diffusion and/or engagement goals.

## Prepare our Pitch

The general flow we've used in pitch meetings goes something like this:

- What is AuxEng?
Simple logistical and vernacular. Explaining embeds, engagements, trainings, and other ways our team may engage with an organization.
- What is (team)?
We take time to emphasize our team's direction and mission. Are we proliferating a practice? Is that practice centered around a tool?
- Why AuxEng?
In the framework of all the ways a team can engage other teams in an organization, it's a reasonable sidenote to mention exactly why AuxEng is the approach that any given team is making.
- What does an embed do?
An "Embed" is the part of an engagement where AuxEng engineers actually code and help a team. Hopefully this guide and website gives enough of a definition that you feel ready to answer this question.
- How do we get started?
This is where much of the framework we've said so far comes together. To start this process and invite folks in to collaborate, we need them to give us a one pager, explaining their problem and solution, so we can evaluate if it makes sense for our team to engage.
