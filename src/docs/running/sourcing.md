# Selecting Teams to Work With

After drumming up interest and clarifying a team's mission, managers and engineers
should be ready to find ways to get teams interested. This might require a lot of
outreach, or you might have found tools important enough that many people will
be delighted to speak with you. It's important to approach all these teams as
similarly as possible, to give them all the best chance of driving value for
your team's goals engaging through AuxEng.

## Intro Meetings

Teams approach us from all over the company looking for advice on starting new
services. We generally explain to the team what our AuxEng program is and give
them some general direction on how to proceed with their project.

Most questions we get and most outline we give stem from the mission of the
AuxEng team that sponsors the engineer. For example, we might have a team that
heavily focuses on best practices for Python. We may outline how we make life
better for engineers that use our recommended tools, how we help setup automation
and quality of life improvements for folks we engage with, and generally pitch
the value we believe our team can bring.

If the team seems interested in AuxEng, and their project seems like a good fit
for us, then we ask them to submit a one page document describing what they
intend to build.

## One-Pager

We ask teams to submit a one page document describing what they intend to build
when they express interest in AuxEng. This allows us to see a condensed version
of their project, and it also gives us an artifact to discuss internally.

The commitment you can expect from a team will also be apparent from one-pager.
For example, you may find that a team is very interested in an intro meeting,
over email, over DM, but when asked to describe their problem or commit
technologists or other resources, they hesitate. Take the effort in a one-pager
to heart when considering an engagement. A team that expects a rigid structure
or form to submit their idea likely has low resources to affect meaningful
change in their work habits, and may not receieve the full benefit AuxEng
can provide.

While we don't provide a strict template for a one-pager, you will generally
want a problem statement, wish list, and some goals (business and technical).

After receiving a One-Pager, We meet internally to rate the one-pager on
three metrics; business value, technical value, and team fit.

## Checking Project Fit

After some introductions and receiving a project brief via a one-pager, we
collect our team and make decisions on if we should proceed. To avoid bias
for or against a particular engagement, we will judge based on three tenets
important to the success of any project. Business Value, Techincal Value, and
Team Fit.

It's best to run this meeting with as much numbers as possible to measure
sentiment. One example would be "Roman Voting" with a 0 for thumbs down, 1
for thumb sideways, and 2 for thumb up in each category listed below.
It's often that multiple engagements must be considered next to one
another, and having a numerical score can reduce bias and choose the best
engagement for your AuxEng team.

### Business Value

We are careful to look for projects that we feel will have a measurable impact
on Wayfair's performance. We often look for projects that can associate a
dollar amount with getting their minimum viable product into production.

Of course, the value of a tool that can solve dollar-amount issues, or of
assisting a team that may creative multiplicative value in helping others is
worth considering while we consider our direct involvement.

A major refactor of a legacy system is an example of a project that we would
consider to have low business value. It might solve a lot of problems for
engineers, but it most likely has little to no immediate value for the business
itself. It's important to weigh this as a _part_ of choosing an engagement.

### Technical Value

We get excited about project that allow us to learn new things, or do something
that has never been done at Wayfair before.

We also look for projects that will have a major effect on a large team of
engineers. Projects that further technical goals for leadership or for known
populations and/or with measureable gaps in their technical needs are great
candidates for high technical value projects. We also consider helping a
large team move to a more modern paradigm to have high technical value.

### Team Fit

We normally pair with a team for three months, so we really care about team fit.
Having poor team fit can ruin an otherwise good project, and cause unnecessary
friction between AuxEng and the host team. You may find that problems can be
logistical, or technical, or both.

Logistically, a team may prefer to hold their stand-up at 6 PM, while an aux
engineer must be clocked out by 5. They may have a distributed team that makes
it difficult to effectively pair with reasonable overlap across time zones. We've
seen teams that even prefer to have night owls working late into the night,
and take some of the next day off. The working habits of your team must
meaningfully overlap to have a successful AuxEng engagement.

Technically, we write tests for our code, and we believe that high test coverage
allows us to move faster, onboard engineers quicker, and refactor more easily.
We deeply believe in testing, linting, containerized development, maintaining
high test coverage, and CI/CD. Some teams believe these practices will "slow
them down" and will "block them from deploying". Writing tests is a skill,
at first it is hard and can take work to learn. If a team isn't interested
in learning to write tests then they are not a good fit for AuxEng.
