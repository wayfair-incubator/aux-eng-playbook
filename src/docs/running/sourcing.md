## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES
- Organizing
    - Until AuxEng is broadly known, start with in person conversation to set expectations
        - Teams are signing up for change
        - AuxEng won't be solving the hard problems in a silo
        - Team must be interested in participating
        - Check timelines
    - Teams produce a 1-page proposal
        - Interested teams produce a 1-page summary doc of project, timeline, technical and business impact goals
- Selection
    - Score on 3 criteria
        - Business Impact
        - Technical Impact
        - Team fit
    - AuxEng team individually scores proposal 0-10 on each criteria
    - Discuss "Why" for each rating
    - Participants get an opportunity to shift their votes
    - Use your judgment, or be strictly mathematical. Either way you have the scoring data to measure
