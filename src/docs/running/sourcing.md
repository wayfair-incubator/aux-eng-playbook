After drumming up interest and [clarifying a team's mission](./expectations.md),
managers and engineers should be ready to find ways to get teams interested.
This might require a lot of outreach, or there may be tools important
enough that many people will be delighted to speak with an Aux team. It's important
to approach all these teams as similarly as possible, to give them all the best
chance of driving value for an Aux Home team's goals in engagements.

## Intro Meetings

We regularly have teams approach us; looking for advice on building new
services. We will explain to the team what our AuxEng program is and give
them some general direction on how to proceed with their project.

Most questions we get and most outline we give stem from the mission of the
AuxEng team that sponsors the engineer. For example, we might have a team that
heavily focuses on best practices for Python. We outline how we make life
better for engineers that use our recommended tools, how we help setup automation
and quality of life improvements for folks we engage with, and [generally pitch](./expectations.md#prepare-the-pitch)
the value we believe our team can bring.

If the team seems interested in AuxEng, and their project seems like a good fit
for us, then we ask them to submit a one page document describing what they
intend to build.

## One-Pager

We ask teams to submit a one page document describing what they intend to build
when they express interest in AuxEng. This allows us to see a condensed version
of their project. It also gives us an artifact to discuss internally.

The commitment we can expect from a team will also be apparent from one-pager.
For example, we may find that a team is very interested in an intro meeting,
speaking over email, and/over DM. When asked to describe their problem, commit
technologists, or other resources, they hesitate. We take the effort in a one-pager
to heart when considering an engagement. A team that expects a rigid structure
or form to submit their one-pager idea likely has low resources to affect
meaningful change in their work habits, and may not recieve the full
benefit AuxEng can provide.

While we don't provide a strict template for a one-pager, we will generally
want a problem statement, wish list, and some goals (business and technical).

After receiving a one-pager, We meet internally to rate the one-pager on
three metrics; business value, technical value, and team fit.

## Checking Project Fit

After some introductions and receiving a project brief via a one-pager, we
collect our team and make decisions on if we should proceed. To avoid bias
for or against a particular engagement, we will judge based on three tenets
important to the success of any project. Business Value, Technical Value, and
Team Fit.

It's best to run this meeting with as much numbers as possible to measure
sentiment. One example would be "Roman Voting" with a 0 for thumbs down, 1
for thumb sideways, and 2 for thumb up in each category listed below.
It's often that multiple engagements must be considered next to one
another, and having a numerical score can reduce bias and choose the best
engagement for our team.

### Business Value

We are careful to look for projects that we feel will have a measurable impact
on Wayfair's performance. We often look for projects that can associate a
dollar amount with getting their minimum viable product into production.
The value of an engagement creating a service that indirectly saves dollars,
or otherwise assisting a team that creatives multiplicative value is also
worth considering.

A major refactor of a legacy system is an example of a project that we would
consider to have low business value. It might solve a lot of problems for
engineers, but it most likely has little to no immediate value for the business
itself. It's important to weigh this as a _part_ of choosing an engagement.

### Technical Value

We get excited about project that allow us to learn new things, or do something
that has never been done at Wayfair before.

We also look for projects that will have a major effect on a large team of
engineers. Projects that further technical goals for leadership or for known
populations (and/or with measurable gaps in their technical needs) are great
candidates for high technical value projects. We also consider helping a
large team move to a more modern paradigm to have high technical value.

### Team Fit

We normally pair with a team for three months, so we really care about team fit.
Having poor team fit can ruin an otherwise good project, and cause unnecessary
friction between AuxEng and the host team. We will discuss problems can be
logistical, or technical, or both.

Logistically, a team may prefer to hold their stand-up at 6 PM, while an aux
engineer must be clocked out by 5. They may have a distributed team that makes
it difficult to effectively pair with reasonable overlap across time zones. We've
seen teams that even prefer to have night owls working late into the night,
and take some of the next day off. The working habits of our team must
meaningfully overlap to have a successful AuxEng engagement.

Technically, we write tests for our code, and we believe that high test coverage
allows us to move faster, onboard engineers quicker, and refactor more easily.
We deeply believe in testing, linting, containerized development, maintaining
high test coverage, and CI/CD. Some teams believe these practices will "slow
them down" and will "block them from deploying". Writing tests is a skill,
at first it is hard and can take work to learn. If a team isn't interested
in learning to write tests then they are not a good fit for AuxEng.
