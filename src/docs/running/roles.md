# Auxiliary Engineering Roles

On a project there will generally be two auxiliary engineers working with the host team.

## Project Engineer

The project engineer is responsible for running the day to day of the AuxEng project.
This includes running retros, attending standup, leading workshops, pairing with engineers, writing tests, helping with features, etc.
The project engineer works with the host team from Monday through Thursday. 
On Fridays they have a free day to focus on other work outside of the project.

The project engineer is generally the face of the project for the host team and will co-locate with the host team.

## Project Advisor

The project advisor is responsible for the overall success of the project.
They are responsible for seeing the big picture and ensuring the project is on track overall.

The advisor works with the host team before the project to define the goals and schedule of the project.
They attend the retros, and periodically meet with the host team's leadership. 
They also provide the project engineer with feedback, coaching, and general support.

The advisor is also responsible for identifying issues with the project. 
The advisor may choose to end the project early if the host team isn't fulfilling their side of the contract.
