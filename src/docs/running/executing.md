We've done it! We've marketed ourselves and set [expectations](./expectations).
The hard work of [sourcing](./sourcing) and [planning](./planning) is finished,
our team is now at the meat and potatoes: doing the aux engagement.

## Weekly Schedule

The first part to get straight with a host team is the schedule we'll work
together.

### 80% Time

We recommend using "80%" time. An [Aux Engineer](./roles) should be with the
host team for 80% of their week, and use their free 20% to keep notes, sync up
with their team, and do any other admin work outside **pairing** time. The
pairing time should be spent doing work to attain the goals of an engagement,
explicitly **not** burning down backlog items that do not archive an
engagement's goals.

### Pairing

We practice pair programming because we believe:

- We share context as fast as possible
- Pairing solves problems faster
- Pairing will diffuse practices in engineers we pair with

If we have another mechanism that we believe achieves these goals
effectively, pair programming may be ok to skip. Otherwise, pair with
folks on a host team of an engagement as much as possible.

With a free day and pairing time outlined, we integrate with team
rituals like stand up, planning, demo sessions, and participate
in those meetings.

### Weekly Retros

During the project we hold weekly 30 minute retros where we discuss the project.
We talk about three things; what went well, what went poorly, and what we should
do next time. We also score the goals and metrics sheet before the retro, and will
review progress with our host team.

In general we welcome feedback, and make it clear that we especially value
negative feedback. If we get through most of the retro without having much in
the "went poorly" column, we explicitly ask for more negative feedback, and
remind people that we value it.

We emphasize getting an MVP in production, and getting real world feedback as
soon as possible. During the weekly retros we talk about how close we are to
launching the MVP, and what is blocking us.

We take notes during this meeting, and after we email the notes to everyone that
came. We try to keep the weekly retros pretty tight, we start them on time and
end early.

### Effective 20% Time

We like to keep the 20% time off of an engagement on Fridays, since
it's most likely that folks would take a long weekend, and/or have
less energy at the end of the week. Friday is a great time to
reflect on an engagement, write documentation that is missing from
products a team provides, give ourself downtime away from a host team
and time to stay involved with an engineers "home" team.

Most Aux Engineers will be coming from a team out to change the culture
of other teams or provide insight an expertise on a platform product.
If an Aux Engineer is teaching other teams about kubernetes, for
example, they would likely have to change mindset about application
infrastructure as well as the actual code. With time to decompress and
take any thoughts from the "away" or "host team to the "home" team --
we create a feedback loop that creates a better experience for the rest
of an engagement. Simple documentation and features can get back to the
"home" team easily during a "20%" day.

## Project Retros

At the end of the project we hold an overall project retro. At the start of the
retro we talk through the timeline for the project, and which major milestones
we've hit together.

Then we talk about three things; what went well, what went poorly, and what we
should do next time for the entire project. We emphasize talking about issues
with the project, and especially like to hear negative feedback; things we can do
better. We take notes during the meeting, and afterwards we email the notes out to
everyone involved with the project.

The scope of the conversation in this retro should be the entire project. It's
a good idea to prime the meeting room by restating goals and progress on them.
A host team for an engagement and engineers engaging have a great opportunity
here to celebrate success and reflect on what could be improved.
By the end of the meeting we ought to have established key takeaways, ways
to improve engagements generally or specifically in process and minutia about
engagement methodology.  

## Project NPS

At the same time as the Project retro we send out an [NPS survey](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/learning-centre/customer-service/calculate-net-promoter-score/)
to ask the host team how likely they would be to recommend AuxEng.

We use NPS to give us a quick overview on how the project went; it is an
important metric for us to drive up or keep level over time. We find ways to
engage sentiment from the team around total product satisfaction, engineering
methodology and tools we share during the engagement.
