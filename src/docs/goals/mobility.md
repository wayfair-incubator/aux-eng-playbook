## WORK IN PROGRESS NOTES
- Senior talent can be strategically moved around the organization with little cost
- AuxEng is design to not build dependency on the guest engineers
- Team receiving a new engineer feels the gains, but team losing the engineer doesn't feel pain
- Engagements can be staggered to be starting every month or so, meaning disruption free re-alignment is an option.
