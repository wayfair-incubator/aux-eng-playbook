## A New Senior Contributor Archetype

Building meaningful career ladders for individual contributors can be a real challenge. One of the ways to support someone's career is to give them multiple role archetypes to choose from, and letting them play on their strengths. One of the goals of Auxiliary Engineering is to give senior engineers a new archetype which feels challenging, rewarding, and well aligned with their long term career success and ambitions.

## Diversity by Design

Providing a fresh problem space with some familiarity in how to solve it can be refreshing for individual contributors. By providing value in many areas through their direct involvement, a shared goal in Aux Eng lies in providing technologists a meaningful breadth of influence. That influence comes from understanding a many of the diverse problems in a software ecosystem. Especially in senior technical tracks and leadership roles, that kind of exposure and influence in an organization goes a long way in building a career.

A shared goal that benefits both the platform an engineer supports and the engineer itself is the ability to recognize patterns in a software ecosystem. Finding opportunities to shake up the meta understanding or expectations technologists hold about a platform or implementation allows for stronger practical innovation. Put another way, the diversity in problem and people exposure will let pattern recognition build better tools -- a benefit to both the platform and the career of the recognizer.

## Practical Practice

As platforms mature and careers mature, it's easy for individual contributors to get bogged down or caught up (depending on how the contributor sees it) in doing stuff that isn't code or practical work. A lot of strategy and planning can take over their schedule, and it's easy in those places to get disconnected from the problems being solved. Mentally and socially, it is exhausting to switch between high-level thinking and low-level implementations.

It's our goal in AuxEng to provide a structure that leaves deliberate time for planning and implementation separately. Given that the practice requires a subject matter expert to be effective in running an engagement at all: this feed into the happiness of the contributor, and a secondary goal for the program. We want our people to feel like they're involved in the organization, solving real problems. We also want them to avoid being a "powerpoint architect" that barely has the chance to actually play with the software and systems they build.

Through direct involvement, as well as the planning of that involvement, we grow engineers into seniority. We retain senior engineers more effectively with these programs by allowing them to "just code again". The knowledge sharing from our senior technical staff and the satisfaction they get from being able to practice their craft is a win-win-win for the platform, the contributor, and the team engaging with us.
